Here's a streamlined version of the setup documentation that reflects your specifications and focuses on using GitHub Pages as a development platform:

### Step 1: Create an Umbrella Project Directory

Start by creating a root directory for your projects in your home directory:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create and navigate into a new project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/my_project
   cd ~/my_project
   ```

### Step 2: Clone the Necessary Repositories

Clone the required repositories from the APL Innovation Lab GitHub organization into your umbrella directory:

- **Clone the apltv repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:APL-Innovation-Lab/apltv.git
  ```
- **Clone the library repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:APL-Innovation-Lab/library.git
  ```

### Step 3: Set Up a Python Web Server

You'll use Python's built-in HTTP server module to serve files from the umbrella directory, making it easy to access the `apltv` project at a specific path.

1. Navigate back to your umbrella directory if you are not already there:
   ```bash
   cd ~/my_project
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

This command will serve the entire umbrella directory on port 8000, enabling access to the `apltv` project at `http://localhost:8000/apltv`.

### Step 5: Accessing the Server

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000/apltv
```

This URL will serve your `apltv` project, making it accessible for development testing.

### Simplified Development with GitHub Pages

This setup is configured to facilitate development using GitHub Pages, allowing for integration with other projects and supporting the possibility of running multiple persistent servers on the same domain. This method ensures a versatile development platform that enhances collaborative efforts and project scalability.
